# Stranded-Alien

Stranded-Alien is a simple video game made using the Godot engine.

The goal is to collect a certain number of coins in order to finish the game. The alien has a "warmth" meter, that needs go be replenished at fire places. The alien will freeze if the meter is depleted.

To play the game on Windows, download the whole project and open the .exe file that is located in the `Playable Game` folder (The .pck file is required to play the game).

If you want a bit of a challange I suggest not reading the tips section at the end and figuring out the game on your own. But, what do i know, I'm just a README file.



### Tips:
- The size of your breath will show you how far you are away from the next fire place.
- Coins spawn around fire places, but they don't always spawn.
